## Introduction

This collection contains data from Regional Climate Models (RCMs) contributing to the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CORDEX-CMIP6) for Australasia, processed in a convenient form for applied users. 

Data for several commonly used surface variables and three model experiments have been regridded to a regular 0.05 degree (~5km) latitude-longitude grid across Australia and then calibrated against two different observational datasets using two different bias correction methods. Users can access the regridded data (i.e. with no bias correction applied) or the bias corrected data.

The regridded data is useful for analysis that compares / combines CORDEX-CMIP6 data across different RCMs, as each individual RCM is run on a different spatial grid. The bias corrected data is useful for analysis of future climate change scenarios for Australia where the application requires data to statistically match observed/reanalysis datasets â€“ including analysis of changes in the variables included, indices derived from these variables (including indices with absolute thresholds) and downstream modelling of areas such as hydrology, agriculture, environmental suitability, fire risk and more.

## Known issues

The BARPA-R dataset has a small number of daily timesteps where the value at all latitude/longitude points is NaN (see the BARPA known issues page for details). Those NaN timesteps are also present in the bias corrected data for all variables except hursmin and hursmax (which were calculated using unaffected hourly BARPA data). The impacted days in the CORDEX-CMIP6-based regridded and calibrated data are as follows:
- ACCESS-CM2 (r4i1p1f1), ssp126: 1-2 Jul 2049
- ACCESS-ESM1-5 (r6i1p1f1), ssp126: 9-10 Sep & 16-17 Oct 2073
- ACCESS-ESM1-5 (r6i1p1f1), ssp370: 21-22 Apr 2029
