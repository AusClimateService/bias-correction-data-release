## Level 1: CORDEX-CMIP6-based regridded and calibrated data for Australia

#### Abstract

This collection contains data from Regional Climate Models (RCMs) contributing to the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CORDEX-CMIP6) for Australasia, processed in a convenient form for applied users. 

Data for several commonly used surface variables and three model experiments (an historical experiment and two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway experiments) have been regridded to a regular 0.05 degree (~5km) latitude-longitude grid across Australia and then calibrated against two different observational datasets using two different bias correction methods.

The collection is useful for analysis of future climate change scenarios for Australia where CORDEX-CMIP6 is an appropriate data source and the application requires data to statistically match observed/reanalysis datasets â€“ including analysis of changes in the variables included, indices derived from these variables (including indices with absolute thresholds) and downstream modelling of areas such as hydrology, agriculture, environmental suitability, fire risk and more.

#### Dataset lineage information

This product was derived from CORDEX-CMIP6 and observational data.

The CORDEX-CMIP6 data was produced by the Bureau of Meteorology (https://dx.doi.org/10.25914/z1x6-dq28), CSIRO (https://dx.doi.org/10.25914/rd73-4m38), NARCliM2.0 (https://dx.doi.org/10.25914/resv-vj43) and the Queensland Future Climate Science Program (https://dx.doi.org/10.25914/8fve-1910).

The observation-based data was from the AGCD (https://dx.doi.org/10.25914/6009600304b02) and BARRA-R2 (https://dx.doi.org/10.25914/90rq-d839) datasets.

This dataset contains data from the NARCliM2.0 project contribution to the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CORDEX-CMIP6) for Australasia, calibrated against the AGCD dataset using the MRNBC bias correction method.

Daily surface temperature and precipitation data are available for three model experiments (historical, SSP1.26 and SSP3.70) on a regular 0.05 degree (~5km) latitude-longitude grid across Australia.

#### Dataset lineage information

This product was produced by applying the Multivariate Recursive Nesting Bias Correction (MRNBC) bias correction method to re-gridded CORDEX-CMIP6 data from the NARCliM2.0 project (dataset 1-1-3).

The reference dataset for the bias correction was AGCD (https://dx.doi.org/10.25914/6009600304b02). 

The MRNBC method is described by Mehrotra and Sharma (2015; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.11.037) with code available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14641855 and https://github.com/AusClimateService/MRNBC. 


## Level 1.2.3.3: CORDEX-CMIP6 data from the NARCliM2.0 project calibrated against BARRA-R2 using the QME method

#### Abstract

This dataset contains data from the NARCliM2.0 project contribution to the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CORDEX-CMIP6) for Australasia, calibrated against the BARRA-R2 dataset using the QME bias correction method.

Daily surface temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, wind speed and relative humidity data are available for three model experiments (historical, SSP1.26 and SSP3.70) on a regular 0.05 degree (~5km) latitude-longitude grid across Australia.

#### Dataset lineage information

This product was produced by applying the Quantile Matching for Extremes (QME) bias correction method to re-gridded CORDEX-CMIP6 data from the NARCliM2.0 project (dataset 1-1-3).

The reference dataset for the bias correction was BARRA-R2 (https://dx.doi.org/10.25914/90rq-d839). 

The QME method is described by Dowdy (2023; http://www.bom.gov.au/research/publications/researchreports/BRR-087.pdf) with code available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14635628 and https://github.com/AusClimateService/QME.

## Level 1.2.4: Calibrated CORDEX-CMIP6 data from the Queensland Future Climate Science Program

#### Abstract

This dataset contains data from the Queensland Future Climate Science Program contribution to the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CORDEX-CMIP6) for Australasia, calibrated against two observational datasets using two different bias correction methods.

Data are available for several commonly used surface variables and three model experiments (an historical experiment and two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway experiments) on a regular 0.05 degree (~5km) latitude-longitude grid across Australia.
